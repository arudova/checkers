checkers
========

English draughts (checkers). The application adheres to the english draughts rules. The board is 8x8, the number of pieces for each side is 12. First move is for the white pieces. Uncrowned pieces (men) move one step diagonally, and (may) capture opponents' pieces by moving two consecutive steps in the same direction, jumping over the opponent's piece on the first step. Multiple opposing pieces may be captured in a single turn provided this is done by successive jumps made by a single piece; these jumps do not need to be in the same direction but may zigzag changing diagonal direction. In English draughts men can capture only forward. When a man reaches the farthest row forward (crownhead or kings row), it becomes a king, and is marked by placing an additional piece on top of the first man, and acquires the ability to move and capture backwards. Flying kings are not used (they don't have the ability to move several squares at a time), a king's only advantage over a man is the ability to move and capture backwards as well as forwards.
